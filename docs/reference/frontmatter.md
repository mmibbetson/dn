# Front Matter

Front matter is a section at the beginning of a note which contains some additional information about the note itself. None of the segments of the front matter are required, and their order is configurable. By default the segments are all enabled and in the following order, when front matter is generated for a note:

| Segment    |
| :--------- |
| title      |
| date       |
| tags       |
| identifier |
